## Goose Gang

For this initial hack I created a friend tech clone for the Goosinals community. In this application you can start a Goose Gang by using sBTC to purchase your initial supply of "Golden Eggs" and selecting an Inscription ID pointing to the Goosinal PFP you would like to use.

Other users of the application can purchase your Golden Eggs to increase on the gangs leaderboard. The top three eggholders will be featured on the main gang page as part of the core squad which can be used for things like offline gaming sessions in squad based games (think Call of Duty) or for any other kinds of games or community promotions.

In addition to the community gangs and squads the application will feature multiple leaderboards including things like:
* Most Eggs Held (overall)
* Gang Egg Supply Count (most popular gang)
* Most Eggs Held in Squads (strongest supporters)
* Goose in Most Squads (they get around)
* Largest Holders (strongest supporters)
* etc.

Other PFP communities could set up similar, and as web 3 games come to Stacks, these dynamic squads can be used in games to provide a layer of game theory a normally boring task of setting up a squad.
